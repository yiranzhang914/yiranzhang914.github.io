Iâ€™m an assistant professor at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), with State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Computer Science Department. Before that, I received my Ph.D. from Tsinghua University in June 2022. For the first two years of my Ph.D, I was under the supervision of Prof. Jun Bi from 2017 to 2019. Unfortunately, he suddenly passed away in Feb., 2019. Then I switched to the supervision of Prof. [Fengyuan Ren](https://nns.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/personal/renfy/renfy.html) from 2019 to 2022. I received my B.S. in computer science and technology from BUPT in 2017 (rank 1/304).
