Iâ€™m an assistant professor at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), with the State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Computer Science Department. Before that, I received my Ph.D. from Tsinghua University in June 2022 (Supervisors: [Prof. Jun Bi](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1715/70637.htm), [Prof. Fengyuan Ren](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1126/3585.htm)). I received my B.S. in computer science and technology from BUPT in 2017 (rank 1/304).
