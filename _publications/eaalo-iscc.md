Coflow scheduling without prior knowledge has been proposed recently. However, the previous solution, Aalo, has two problems: it does not explicitly control the flow rate; it assumes the network is ideally non-blocking (with perfect traffic balancing and no oversubscription). In this paper, we show the performance loss caused by the above two problems. We propose EAalo to cope with the problems. It has three enhancements to Aalo: per-flow bandwidth enforcement, centralized traffic balancing and oversubscription adaption. We evaluate EAalo with simulations. The simulation results show that EAalo has much better performance than Aalo. It can speed up coflow completion by up to 11%, 17% and 19% in non-blocking networks, networks without oversubscription and networks with 2:1 oversubscription respectively.
